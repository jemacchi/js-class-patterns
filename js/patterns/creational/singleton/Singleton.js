	* @cdxd.classdesc SingletonPattern 'The Singleton Pattern limits the number of instances of a particular object to just one. This single instance is called the singleton.<br><br>Singletons are useful in situations where system-wide actions need to be coordinated from a single central place. An example is a database connection pool. The pool manages the creation, destruction, and lifetime of all database connections for the entire application ensuring that no connections are 'lost'.<br><br>Singletons reduce the need for global variables which is particularly important in JavaScript because it limits namespace pollution and associated risk of name collisions. The Module pattern (see our JavaScript + jQuery Design Pattern Framework) is JavaScript's manifestation of the Singleton pattern.<br><br>Several other patterns, such as, Factory, Prototype, and Fa√ßade are frequently implemented as Singletons when only one instance is needed.'
